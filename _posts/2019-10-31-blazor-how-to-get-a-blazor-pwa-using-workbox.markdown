Hi everyone, this is the 4th part of my serie of articles about Blazor, and today, we will talk about getting an installable Blazor PWA (Progressive Web App) using Workbox.

If you still not have heard about it, PWA are apps which are getting closer to the look and feel of "real" desktop applications, by getting the ability to be installable, working offline, accessing to push notifications and so on.

I personally like a lot the idea of being able to provide an easy installable app on any OS (Windows, Android, iOS) without having to use different tooling, languages, etc.

To keep it simple, a PWA needs mainly 2 files :
- a `manifest.json` file describing our installable app (name, icons, etc.),
- and a `sw.js` Service Worker file to handle the offline caching, push notifications, etc.

Let's see more in details how to add them.

## Describing our installable Blazor app with a manifest.json file

Adding a `manifest.json` file to our Blazor app is pretty straightforward, we just need to put it in our `wwwroot` folder to get it published, and we also need to add a reference to this file in our `index.html` file.

A `manifest.json`  looks like someone like this:

`manifest.json`
```json
{
  "short_name": "blazor-workbox-pwa",
  "name": "Blazor Workbox PWA",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "/images/icons-192.png",
      "type": "image/png",
      "sizes": "192x192"
    },
    {
      "src": "/images/icons-512.png",
      "type": "image/png",
      "sizes": "512x512"
    }
  ],
  "start_url": "/",
  "background_color": "#3367D6",
  "display": "standalone",
  "scope": "/",
  "theme_color": "#3367D6"
}
```

Mainly, it will enable us to define our app naming (`short_name`, `name`), cosmetics (`icons`,  `background_color`, `theme_color`), offline `start_url`, etc.

> Note: You can find more information [here](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest).

We also need to add some more assets such as icons, favicon, etc. to get a pretty PWA, and also add the following line in the `<head>` tag of our `index.html` file:
```html
<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json">
```

Here is what it should look like in [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools)

## Get an offline working Blazor PWA with Workbox

In addition to all the greatness I have already describe in my [first article about Blazor](https://www.vivienfabing.com/blazor/2019/10/10/blazor-what-is-blazor.html#blazor-webassembly), another one worth mentioning is that getting our Blazor app working like a standard SPA gives us access to all the standard tooling available on internet, already used by other SPA frameworks!

And frankly, one tool that I am particularly happy to have access to is [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox).

I don't know if you ever tried to write a Service Worker using Vanilla JavaScript, but personally it wasn't one of my best experience in development :)

So `Workbox` is a popular tool (*Maintained by a [small company](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/workbox) you have probably heard of haha*) which, I think, simplify greatly the development of Service Workers.

In a nutshell, it is a tool which can be used in command line, and which will help us generate a Service Worker `sw.js` file, ready to be referenced in our `index.html` file.

First, we will need a `workbox-config.js` file like the following one:
```js
module.exports = {
    "globDirectory": "bin/Release/netstandard2.0/publish/blazor-workbox-pwa/dist",
    "globPatterns": [
        '**/*.{html,json,js,css,png,ico,json,wasm,dll}'
    ],
    "swDest": "bin/Release/netstandard2.0/publish/blazor-workbox-pwa/dist/sw.js"
};
```
Where:
- `globDirectory` tells `Workbox` where to look for files to be cached for offline usage, in our case, it will be our `dotnet publish` output folder.
- `globPatterns` describe the pattern to find all the files to cache such as `html`, `css`, `js` and other assets, but also `wasm` and `dll` because we are running a mono webassembly app :)
- and `swDest` to tell where to put the generated Service Worker `sw.js` file, in our case next to our other files in the output folder.

> Note: there are other options available for the config.file. You can have more information on the [official documentation](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-build#generatesw_mode)

Lastly, we will need to add a reference to our generated Service Worker in our `index.html` by adding the following lines at the end of our `<body>` tag:
```html
<script>
    // Check that service workers are supported
    if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
        // Use the window load event to keep the page load performant
        window.addEventListener('load', () => {
            navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js');
        });
    }
</script>
```

Finally to generate our production package, we just need to run the following command lines:
```cmd
dotnet publish -c Release
workbox generateSW workbox-config.js
```
Host your production package into your favourite hosting service (*[more examples here](https://www.vivienfabing.com/blazor/2019/10/24/blazor-how-to-host-a-blazor-app.html)*)...
Et voil√†! We get a fully running `Blazor PWA` installable with offline support!

Notice that despite the network being set to `offline`, we can still play with our application!

One more final check, let's inspect our app in [Chrome Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse#devtools)

Not bad for a start in so few lines of code :)

## In conclusion

I hope this article gave you a nice overview of the possibilities of transforming your `Blazor` app into a nice `PWA` using Workbox.

I have also set up a small working Github repository named [`blazor-workbox-pwa`](https://github.com/vfabing/blazor-workbox-pwa) if you want to have a more concrete example.

Feel free to reach me out on Twitter [@vivienfabing](https://twitter.com/vivienfabing) or anywhere else, and may the code be with you!
