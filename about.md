My name is Vivien Fabing. I'm a programmer, loving .NET for its clean architecturing capabilities and I am passionated about team work.
I currently work in Paris and try to be a good [ALM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_lifecycle_management) Tech Lead at [Infinite Square](https://infinitesquare.com/), but this blog, its content and opinions are my own.

I was also awarded by the [Microsoft MVP (Developer Technologies)](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5003680) this year!
